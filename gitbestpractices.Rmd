## Why use it? or better, why not use it?

- Everyone uses version control -- this is a way to formalize it

## Why use it? or better, why not use it?

- Project management
- It is your project's web presence, and part of your personal web presence; in some fields it is almost an expectation
- Part of a suite of open science tools 

## Arguments against

- It does take some buy-in from everyone participating
- (perceived to have) a steep learning curve

## Stories?

- Does anyone have any good stories or horror stories?

## Use cases

During

- use it solo to organize your work
- multiple team members can contribute to a repository simultaneously

After

- publish a repository to the web (e.g. to make results from a publication open and reproducible)
  + Note: this may require ongoing maintenance!

## How it works

- what is git 
- github and gitlab - central repository to keep all collaborators synchronized
- definition of master
- definition of fork and clone
- definition of push and pull

## Git in RStudio

- Creating a new project under version control
- Making changes, committing, and pushing
- Pulling
- Branches (master vs other branches)

## R package workflow 

- Use this as a way to demonstrate how you would maintain a published product, and/or contribute to other people's projects

- introduce pull requests and issues (can be used internally or externally), issues can be used to track tasks/for project mgmt.
- there are other options for project management
- another example is submitting assignments in a class as issues to a repo that point to a commit

## Example: Q's personal GitHub

- <https://github.com/qdread>
- DISCLAIMER: this does not entirely embody best practices!!!

## Example: SESYNC Cyberinfrastructure GitHub

- <https://github.com/sesync-ci/>
  + [Project containing all lessons in curriculum](https://github.com/orgs/SESYNC-ci/projects/2) -- good demonstration of project management
  + [rslurm package](https://github.com/SESYNC-ci/rslurm) -- note the issues and pull requests

## Outside resources

- [Using zenodo to get a DOI for your published git repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- [Hadley Wickham's book on packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
- [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) Excellent paper by Jenny Bryan, which I shamelessly copied from for this presentation


## SESYNC resources

- [document with resources on learning GitHub Pages](https://github.com/SESYNC-ci/sesync-ci.github.io/blob/master/blog/_drafts/github-pages-resources.md) -- this is still a draft in progress!
